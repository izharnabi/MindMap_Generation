# 🧠 MindMapp_Generation

The **MindMap Project** is designed to automatically **analyze, extract, and visualize website header structures** into an interactive mind map format.  
It leverages **Playwright** for intelligent web navigation and scraping, **Python** for data processing, and visualization libraries for generating structured hierarchical maps.

This system aims to simplify understanding of a website’s **information architecture**, **menu hierarchy**, and **navigation flow** — especially useful for **UX designers**, **SEO analysts**, and **web automation engineers**.
